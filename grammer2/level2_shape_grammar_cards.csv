Cone + Cylinder,Core,"A tapered cone stacked on a stable cylinder—like a megaphone, lamp base, party hat on a head, or soft-serve ice cream.","Funnels, nozzles, horns, tool handles, lamps, architecture, decorative columns, hats.","Curved, stable base with a directional upper taper. Smooth round transition where they meet.","The base cylinder gives grounding and vertical mass; the cone adds flow and emphasis. Together, they teach how to stack directional tension on stable forms—great for learning weight distribution, design rhythm, and contrast in volume."
Cone + Rectangular Prism,Core,"A pointed cone mounted on a blocky base—think pencil tips, missile heads, roof ornaments, or rocket boosters.","Writing tools, weapons, rockets, medieval towers, machine parts, sculptural design.","Angular vs. curved contrast. The prism sits flat and geometric; the cone rises to a point, creating tension and focus.","The rectangular prism provides solidity and alignment with perspective, while the cone disrupts it with radial flow. This combo teaches contrast stacking—how to combine precise, boxy mass with organic taper for directional storytelling and visual hierarchy."
Cube + Cylinder,Core,"A square block perched on a round base—like a gumball machine top, podium fixture, stool seat, or turret.","Furniture, machines, kiosks, stage design, packaging, sci-fi props.",Flat planes over cylindrical curves. The bottom curves horizontally while the top remains rigid and boxy.,"The cylinder provides vertical flow and radial symmetry; the cube interrupts it with planar edges and perspective anchoring. This combo teaches vertical centering, spatial grounding, and how to mix curvature with cornered geometry in object design."
Hexagonal Prism + Cylinder,Core,"A six-sided column sitting on a rounded base—like a socket wrench on a handle, sci-fi battery pack, or ornate column.","Tools, structural supports, game props, electronics, architectural details.",Cylinder offers smooth curvature and balance; hex prism introduces crisp angles and radial rhythm on top.,The cylinder sets rotation and balance; the hexagonal prism stacks complex symmetry on top. This combo teaches rotational alignment and how to place angular structures onto stable curved bases without breaking volume logic.
Hexagonal Prism + Rectangular Prism,Core,"A six-sided form anchored on a rectangular base—like a mechanical tower, pencil in a holder, battery pack, or stylized beam.","Sci-fi pillars, industrial supports, tech components, handheld devices, tool shafts.",Angular-on-angular structure; hex prism adds radial edges while the rectangular prism emphasizes planar volume and length.,"The rectangular prism locks orientation in perspective; the hex prism introduces directional complexity and surface rhythm. This combo teaches how to layer symmetrical angular forms over linear bases, reinforcing rhythm, orientation, and functional believability."
Octahedron + Ovaloid,Core,"A sharp, angular crystal form balanced on a soft, bulging base—like a fantasy gem set in muscle, or a futuristic antenna on a helmet.","Sci-fi joints, creature anatomy, decorative artifacts, fantasy weaponry, stylized tech.","Top is faceted and symmetrical with strong triangular planes; base is smooth, asymmetrical, and organic.","The ovaloid creates directional organic mass, while the octahedron radiates sharp tension. This combo teaches how to contrast geometric rigidity with organic flow—ideal for stylized designs where hard meets soft in believable ways."
Ovaloid + Cylinder,Core,"An organic, rounded form mounted on a stable, rotating base—like a helmet on a neck, fruit on a stem, or muscle on a limb.","Creature design, helmets, anatomy joints, bottle shapes, character props.","Bottom is uniform and cylindrical; top is asymmetrical with bulging, shifting volume.",The cylinder sets vertical alignment and rotational logic; the ovaloid adds organic variation and directional mass. This combo teaches how to transition from mechanical symmetry to organic irregularity—critical for blending lifelike form with structural support.
Pyramid + Cube,Core,"A sharp pyramid mounted on a solid cube—like a roof on a house, a bishop chess piece, or a stylized turret.","Architecture, game assets, religious icons, abstract sculpture, machine caps.","Cube is flat and stable with rigid edges; pyramid tapers dramatically to a point, adding height and emphasis.",The cube locks into perspective with parallel edges; the pyramid interrupts with converging verticals. This combo teaches how to crown a grounded shape with directional energy—ideal for learning silhouette hierarchy and how to imply function through form.
Pyramid + Sphere,Core,"A sharp, angular point rising from a perfect round base—like a fantasy artifact, a spiked jewel, or a stylized warning symbol.","Game icons, magical objects, character accessories, creature anatomy, environmental props.","The sphere is smooth, continuous, and curves away in all directions; the pyramid cuts through with straight edges and a precise apex.","The sphere provides omnidirectional volume; the pyramid pierces it with upward tension. This combo teaches how to break organic continuity with sharp geometry—useful for designing focal points, directional emphasis, or creating visual contrast that implies tension or energy."
Sphere + Cube,Core,"A round form resting on a square block—like a ball on a pedestal, an eyeball in a socket, or a decorative finial.","Statues, architecture, anatomy, sensors, abstract design elements.","The cube is rigid, planar, and perspective-bound; the sphere contrasts with smooth, continuous curvature.",The cube anchors perspective and provides stability; the sphere disrupts it with pure curvature. This combo teaches spatial contrast—how to balance curved organic mass atop rigid geometric form without breaking logic or weight distribution.
Sphere + Cylinder,Core,"A perfect orb mounted on a smooth vertical base—like a lightbulb on a socket, a microphone head, or a potion bottle.","Lamps, mics, anatomy (joints, heads), props, stylized containers.","Cylinder defines vertical flow with elliptical caps; sphere adds even, radial volume above it.","The cylinder sets rotational alignment and grounding; the sphere interrupts with omnidirectional mass. This combo teaches centered stacking, weight balance, and how to blend even curvature with controlled axial structure—ideal for forms that must rotate, tilt, or be held."
Sphere + Octahedron,Core,"A smooth orb balanced atop a sharp, angular crystal—like a magic relic, sensor node, or sci-fi beacon.","Fantasy props, power cores, joint designs, stylized tech, energy devices.","The octahedron has faceted triangle faces converging to points; the sphere contrasts with smooth, continuous curvature.","The octahedron radiates sharp structural tension; the sphere softens it with perfect symmetry. This combo teaches how to fuse tension and calm in a single form—great for signaling importance, energy, or balance in object design."
Sphere + Ovaloid (Horizontal),Core,"A balanced orb resting on a sideways organic form—like an eye on a muscle, a bead on a pod, or a yolk on a bean.","Anatomy (shoulders, hips, eye forms), stylized fruit, creature design, soft product modeling.","Ovaloid stretches horizontally with asymmetrical bulges; the sphere sits upright, adding vertical contrast and radial balance.","The horizontal ovaloid establishes directional flow and organic mass; the sphere introduces centered, upright volume. This combo teaches how to anchor spherical forms to irregular organic bases—key for believable anatomy, stylized balance, and object posing."
Triangular Prism + Rectangular Prism,Core,"A slanted, angular form mounted on a long box—like a ramp on a base, a wedge blade on a handle, or a stylized nose bridge.","Tools, blades, stairs, mechanical parts, furniture, simplified anatomy.","Rectangular prism offers flat, rigid volume; triangular prism adds directional slope and edge tension.","The rectangular prism anchors the form in space with stable proportions; the triangular prism introduces tilt, asymmetry, and motion cues.
