Sphere,Core,"A perfectly round, symmetrical shape where every surface point is equidistant from the center.","Foundation for heads, joints, eyeballs, planets, fruit, and smooth organic masses.",No edges or corners; light wraps evenly.,Always curves away in every direction—no flat planes. This is the first time you’ll be drawing volume. It teaches how light moves smoothly across curved surfaces.
Cube,Core,A six-faced box with equal sides and 90° angles—your ultimate training tool for structure and perspective.,"Foundation for skull blocks, torsos, buildings, boxes, furniture, and anything geometric or manmade.","Hard edges, flat planes, and visible corners.","Always aligns with perspective lines—parallel edges converge, not curve. Teaches how to anchor form to space, so you stop floating around and start constructing with intent."
Cylinder,Core,"A tube-shaped form with two circular ends connected by a curved side—think arms, tree trunks, pipes, and marker pens.","Limbs, necks, columns, cans, barrels—basically anything that rotates or stacks.",Circular cross-sections and long vertical or horizontal volume.,"Side is curved, ends are ellipses in perspective (not circles!). This shape teaches you to track rotation and flow through a form. It’s your intro to drawing depth with control."
Pyramid,Core,A four-triangle-sided form sitting on a square base—basically a cone that studied geometry and got sharp.,"Roofs, hats, fangs, mountains, noses, stonework, architectural details, and stylized forms.","Sharp point, wide base; directional form with dramatic angle shifts.","Volume rises from a square base to a single apex—edges meet cleanly, and base stays flat in perspective. Teaches silhouette power and visual hierarchy through sharp, intentional mass."
Cone,Core,"A circular base tapering smoothly to a single point. Think traffic cones, party hats, noses, and rocket tips.","Tapered forms like noses, claws, horns, breasts, tree tops, and wizard hats.",Circular base + narrowing body + vanishing tip.,"One end is wide and flat (ellipse), the other is a singular point—volume always flows from base to tip. Teaches directional flow and tension. You’ll use this to show where energy is building or fading."
Rectangular Prism,Core,"A stretched box shape—like a cube that hit puberty and grew long. Think bricks, books, planks, phones, and bodies.","Limbs, torsos, boxes, books, shipping containers, architecture, and any elongated rigid object.","Flat faces, straight edges, varying side lengths.","Three sets of parallel lines; always respects perspective—just like the cube, but stretched. Teaches how to express proportion and support across form—it’s the backbone of most believable object structure."
Triangular Prism,Core,A shape with two triangle ends and three rectangular sides—like a slice of Toblerone or a tent.,"Roofs, wedges, noses, kneecaps, machinery parts, blades, and stylized hair chunks.","Angular, directional, and asymmetrical in many poses—rarely sits flat without creating tension.",Two matching triangles connected by long side planes—perspective warps both ends. Teaches angled stability and flow; this shape adds energy and edge to your forms.
Ovaloid,Core,"A stretched, squished, or tilted egg shape—somewhere between a sphere and a teardrop. Used constantly in organic design.","Heads, ribcages, seeds, fruit, butts, thighs, shoulders, helmets—you name it.","Smooth, asymmetrical curves with a directional bulge; no hard edges.","One end is fuller or rounder—volume always shifts across the form, never uniform. Teaches how to distort mass gracefully and create lifelike irregularity—essential for organic form."
Hexagonal Prism,Core,"A six-sided prism—like a bolt, crystal, pencil, or sci-fi building block.","Crystals, mechanical parts, insect legs, pencils, sci-fi panels, stylized architecture.",Six flat sides wrapping evenly around; strong radial rhythm and symmetry.,Two hexagon ends connected by six rectangles—must rotate cleanly in space and show correct edge spacing. Teaches how to rotate rhythmically and track multi-edge structures with accuracy.
Octahedron,Core,"An eight-faced, double-pyramid shape—four triangles on top, four on the bottom.","Crystals, joints, sci-fi elements, stylized torsos, wings, hips, gemstones, and joints under tension.",Angular symmetry; each point leads into a triangle. Light plays dramatically across its surfaces.,"Every face is an equilateral triangle; volume radiates from the center outward. Teaches how structure radiates under pressure—this one feels built to explode, contract, or pivot."
